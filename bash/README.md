# Bash
This part is rather to remind myself what is `bash` which is used daily by Linux users and I am. (assuming that the default shell is `bash`).
```
echo $SHELL
```
- If the above command prints `/bin/bash` or any path with `bash`. You are welcome!
- All files related to .bash* (except .bash_history).
- Look into the files and take only the necessary part of bash script. Otherwise, undesired bash variables or aliases might be set.
